2. [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule), you may
   reiterate the contents of the meeting *without* attribution.

These rules are in place so that BitDevs participants can speak freely

# Agenda
1. Review of technical Bitcoin news
2. Blind cryptographic signatures and Chaumian ecash


## Blind cryptographic signatures and Chaumian ecash

[Blind signatures were proposed in 1983 by David Chaum](https://www.hit.bme.hu/~buttyan/courses/BMEVIHIM219/2009/Chaum.BlindSigForPayment.1982.PDF) and implemented by [Digicash in the 1990s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecash) and are now coming back as building blocks in Bitcoin Layer 2s such as [Fedimint](https://fedimint.org/) and [Cashu](https://cashu.space/).

Reading material:
- The short [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_signature) on blind signatures
- A [series of very short videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcB9nH78Ths) explaining blind signatures
- A [2-hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwMzNE1D3so) starting from blind signatures, building Chaumian ecash mints and using them in Bitcoin. (use the Table of Contents to skip to the sections of interest).
