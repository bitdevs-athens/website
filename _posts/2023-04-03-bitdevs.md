It's time for our second BitDevs!
The event will be held in English and is free. After the event we will head to dinner/drinks. We would like to thank [Yodeck](https://www.yodeck.com/) for hosting us

### Monday, April 3rd 2023 @ 7PM

As a reminder, the ground rules of BitDevs are as follow:

1. No photos, videos, or recordings.
1. [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): you may
   reiterate the contents of the meeting *without* attribution.

These rules exist so that BitDevs participants can speak freely
within the event.
