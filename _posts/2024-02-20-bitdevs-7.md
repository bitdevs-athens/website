As a reminder, the ground rules of BitDevs are as follows:

1. No photos, videos, or recordings.
2. [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule), you may
   reiterate the contents of the meeting *without* attribution.

These rules are in place so that BitDevs participants can speak freely within the event.

# Agenda

1. Review of technical Bitcoin news
2. Homomorphic encryption

## Homomorphic encryption

Homomorphic encryption is a useful cryptographic building block; one use case is to query a database without telling the server (such as a blockchain explorer) what you searched for.

- [Explaining the Recent Rise of Fully Homomorphic Encryption in the Blockchain Industry](https://medium.com/@mustafa.hourani/explaining-the-recent-rise-of-fully-homomorphic-encryption-in-the-blockchain-industry-c7081fa05458)
